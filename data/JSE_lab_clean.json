            "this does have an implication for us",
            "it turns out that there's a difference between a region set to have a fixed time of day previously set in the floater estate tab and one that just has a fixed sky the phase control from that dialog causes the two lsl functions above to behave differently",
            "when the region is set to a fixed sun that causes the llgetsundirection to always return that fixed value rather than one dependent on the time it also seems to change llgettimeofday but in a less clear our current implementation will break that since we are never setting the fixed sun flag",

            "i think the correct solution to reconcile this is for us to change the code so that if the estate manager selects a fixed sky in the environment tab then we tell the sim that it is a fixed sun region but instead of having a phase control there we extract the sun position from the selected sky preset",
            "this will ensure that the llgetsundirection will return a value that points to the apparent sun in any fixed sky region",
