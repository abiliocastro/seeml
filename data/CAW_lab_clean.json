            "this hk generated config var is a long string that contains the entire credentials for a specific db and must be parsed into their respective array elements in laravel in case it is ever needed we also want to be able to continue to manually specify the db credentials in the vars or use the hk credentials base on yet a different var",

            "this new function will need to account for having a single hk db config var or several",
