            "this task builds on to remove the fsync in step without reducing any durability or consistency guarantees",
            "the basic issue is that we need some way for storage engines to communicate to the server layer when a commit is durably flushed to disk",
            "once the server knows that all commits in a particular binlog file are durably flushed in all storage engines it can write a new binlog checkpoint event as the old file will then no longer be needed for crash recovery",
            "currently this communication is implicit in the commit method of the handlerton the engine guarantees that the transaction will be durably flushed during but for engines that support the interface we know that commits will be done in the same order in the binlog and in innodb",
            "so the server layer does not need to be informed of the flush of every transaction",
            "all we need is to know when the last transaction in a binlog file is durably flushed to disk then we are sure that all prior transactions are also flushed and that the binlog file will no longer be needed for crash recovery so we can log a new binlog checkpoint event",
            "it might be possible to also handle storage engines that do not support but we do not consider this in this task",
            "thus the basic idea is when the server layer decides to rotate the current binlog it queues to each supporting engine a request to be informed when the last transaction in the binlog is durably flushed to disk",

            "innodb extensions in innodb and xtradb we will implement the new method to simply flush the innodb redo log and return",
            "if desired we can later refine this so that such flush is done asynchronously",

            "we extend this so that the count is the sum of not yet flushed xids and outstanding when we decide to rotate the binlog we loop over all engines increment the counter for that binlog and call for engines that implement it passing a pointer to the list entry for the corresponding binlog file",
            "then in we decrement the counter again",
            "when the counter drops to zero we know that all calls have occured and all unlog calls have happened so we can log a new binlog checkpoint and remove the entry from the list",

            "commit the transaction to the storage this is different from normal semi-synchronous replication where steps and are reversed",
            "this task is about implementing enhanced semi-synchronous replication in a way that interacts well with mariadb group commit",
            "in oracle mysql the enhanced semi-synchronous replication would be very expensive as the global is held over the entire operation which would seriously limit throughput",
            "with mariadb a whole group of transactions can enter each stage in parallel so high thoughput can be maintained",
            "a benefit of enhanced semi-synchronous replication is that a transaction does not become visible until at least one slave has acknowledged the reception of it",
            "this means that if a master is completely lost any transaction seen by other connections will be replicated somewhere avoiding a potential phantom read issue",
            "for more discussion see implementation in mariadb group commit a group of commits queue up while waiting for the previous group to finish",
            "this happens after the prepare step once the previous group finishes we have in step a list of commits that we write to the binary log",
            "to implement enhanced semi-synchronous replication we simply add a step just after where we wait for slave acknowledgement of the last binlog position of the entire group",
            "we introduce a new mutex for this so that we can release before the wait and wait with taking until after the wait this allows stage to run in parallel with stage and while still preserving correct ordering and avoiding one stage getting ahead of the other",
            "the mutexes must be chained meaning that we must take the next lock before releasing the previous otherwise one group might overtake previous group causing incorrect ordering of events see the code in for details",
            "the stage should be added as another kind of hook replication is using such we will use the option to enable enhanced semi-synchronous replication following the google patch when plugin can use the new hook instead of the current hook",
            "crash scenarios if a master crashes before a transaction t is written into the binlog that transaction will be rolled back during crash recovery upon server restart as normal",
            "if t was written and synced into binlog but not yet acknowledged by any slave and master crashes then t will be committed during crash recovery",
            "in this case it is possible for a connection to see t committed on the master before any slave has had time to connect to the master and receive it",
            "thus if we crash again right after crash recovery and completely loose the master it is possible for a connection to have seen t on the master while t is now effectively missing from the system",
            "to fix this one option is to somehow have the master wait after crash recovery for at least one slave to connect and acknowledge all recovered commits thus extending the to crash recovery phase",
            "an alternative may be for the dba to prevent connections to the server after a crash until at least one slave has caught up show master status on master and select on if t was acknowledged by at least one slave then we know that t exists both in master binlog which is synced before sending to slaves and slave thus when master crash recovery is done t will be on both master and that slave",
            "and if we completely loose the master t will still eventually be applied on the slave unless we loose both master and slave at the same if a slave crashes during the commit on master nothing special should happen unless all connected slaves crash leaving the master without any slaves connected",

            "goal the goal of this task is to create a set of tests which could be used for acceptance/conformance testing of a storage engine",
            "the suite it not supposed to provide exhaustive engine testing and certainly cannot test engine-specific features due to its very nature of being agnostic to the engine under test but rather perform a relatively quick evaluation of standard functionality expected from a storage engine",
            "problems to solve existing mtr tests are not very suitable for running on different storage engines",
            "problem varying result files traditional have very strict requirements in regard to test output",
            "since different storage engines are likely to produce a slightly different output even if the difference is innocent the tests start failing which causes false positives",
            "example neither is wrong and yet if we have one variant in the result file for another engine the test will fail",
            "till recently the only solution was to copy the whole suite somewhere and recreate result files thus introducing usually unwanted code duplication",
            "solution to solve this problem we will use functionality developed in scope of with this task the original test results can be adapted to the storage engine by creating diff files basically these patches are stored in the engine folder rather than in the mtr suite folder so no changes in the original test suite is performed",
            "problem unsupported features most of tests use combinations of various features even if not all of them are strictly necessary in scope of this exact test",
            "it means that if an engine does not support at least one feature either by design or because it has not been implemented yet the whole test becomes inapplicable",
            "for example if a traditional mtr test for alter table uses at least one key and keys are not supported the test will fail not just produce a result mismatch which we could patch but actually fail in the middle of execution so we will have to stop running it and alter table will not be tested at all and the same will happen to any test which uses keys even if used briefly for an unimportant part of the test",
            "this problem is even bigger than the first one because not only does it currently require copying the test suite and maintaining a separate set of result files but also modifying the test files themselves and often modifications will be extensive enough to rule out even the possibility of future merges with the original test suite",
            "solution we will solve this problem by allowing all tests to run through intermediate failures to the end unless the server crashes or a syntax error in the test itself thus the tests will also produce mismatches and the engine maintainer will be able to decide whether the test is really inapplicable and needs to be disabled or the partial failures are acceptable and can be stored in the result diff file",
            "example we are testing that a table option is supported by the engine merely is accepted and stored lets say we create a table with the option and check that it is not lost but we also want to see that it works with alter so we add an alter table statement where the option is modified",
            "now if we try to run such a test with federated engine it will break on alter not because the option is unsupported but because alter is",
            "in the storage engine test suite the test will continue to the end and will produce a mismatch because the alter statement will cause an then someone who tunes the suite for federated engine can see the difference decide that reasonable since alter is not supposed to work and create an rdiff file",
            "thus we do not skip the test for the table option entirely but simply limit the testing to functionality the engine supports",
            "the tests will try to be smart in their internal logic but within reason",
            "when a statement is likely to fail a feature is often unsupported the test will check the result of the statement and will produce a verbose error message including versions why it could happen",
            "also if a failure happened on table creation or in some other key moment so that a part of test becomes useless if a table was not created there is no point at trying to alter it etc",
            "the test will ignore a part of the flow and proceed to the next part",
            "but it does not happen always the checks are only performed when the probability of a failure is reasonably high",
            "of course if a part of the test is bypassed it will also cause a mismatch so the maintainer will be aware of that and will be able to check why it happens",
            "additionally some tests will check the value of the default index see below notes about configuration and if it is unset certain tests will be completely skipped because every part of them requires indexes for the functionality described in the engines table transactions savepoints xa if a test requires one of the features and it is shown as unsupported in the table the test will produce a warning",
            "but unlike with the indexes it will not be skipped because we assume that for a new engine information in the engines table might be inaccurate",
            "problem different primitives some engines have specifics which makes even simplest hardcoded statements inapplicable",
            "for example whenever a test contains create table t i int it will fail for csv engine because it does not allow columns",
            "or an engine might require certain table options like a connection string for federated engine",
            "since there is obviously no connection string in generic tests every table creation for federated will fail and nothing will be tested",
            "currently there is no way to work around that apart from copying the tests and modifying them manually",
            "in even more complicated scenario in order to create a table properly additional actions need to be performed to create a functional merge table we need to also create an underlying myisam table and if we want to alter a merge table we should alter the underlying accordingly",
            "solution we will provide the engine maintainer with several tools to tune the suite for their engine",
            "some variables can be set to configure the basic test behavior the engine name to be used in create table and be masked in show create table default column options when any are required not null for csv default table options when any are required connection for federated default index unique index primary key whichever supported or a special index default types int type char type in case standard ones are not supported if any actions need to be performed each test they can be described in include files which are always executed creation of a server for federated before a test and dropping it after a test if a server requires procedures for table creation or modification they can be tuned in include files which tests to use to perform these actions create and alter table are not run directly in the tests only by calling the include files so they are configurable the engine can have its own set of disabled files so that there is no need to provide only selected test names on the mtr command line the whole suite can be run and unnecessary files can be disabled through the list server options can be configured combinations can be configured for the engine subsuites can be completely ignored for the engine so that if there is no interest in running partitioning tests or transactional tests they can be simply omitted without any effort",
